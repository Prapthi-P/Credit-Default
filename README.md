**Problem statement:**

This business problem is a supervised learning example for a credit card company. The objective is to predict the probability of default (whether the customer will pay the credit card bill or not) based on the variables provided. There are multiple variables on the credit card account, purchase and delinquency information which can be used in the modelling.

PD modelling problems are meant for understanding the riskiness of the customers and how much credit is at stake in case the customer defaults. This is an extremely critical part in any organization that lends money [both secured and unsecured loans].
